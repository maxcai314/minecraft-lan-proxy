# minecraft-lan-proxy
proxy any Minecraft server as a LAN world from your computer

This is a simple Java program that opens up and advertises your computer as a
Minecraft LAN world, but proxies connections to a different server.

This allows players nearby to discover and connect to your server and play while the program is running.
